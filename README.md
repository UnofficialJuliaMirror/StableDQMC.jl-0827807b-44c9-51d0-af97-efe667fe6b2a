This is a small collection of linear algebra routines for performing inversions, as they appear in the calculation of Green's functions in [determinant Quantum Monte Carlo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_Monte_Carlo), in a numerically stabilized manner.

For more details, check out the accompanyig [paper](https://github.com/crstnbr/StableDQMC.jl/raw/master/paper/stabilization.pdf), in which we describe and benchmark a few specific algorithms.

Feel free to give feedback, open issues, or contribute useful algorithms yourself! ðŸ™‚
