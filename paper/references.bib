abstract = {We discuss a new functional-integral formulation of interacting fermion systems on a lattice such as the Anderson or Hubbard models: the fermion-fermion interaction is eliminated by introducing auxiliary Ising variables. The resulting model for a d-dimensional quantum system is a (d+1)-dimensional Ising model with complicated interactions. The new transformation is particularly useful for performing numerical studies of these models using Monte Carlo techniques. We study its convergence properties and compare it with the usual Gaussian formulation for the case of the Hubbard model.},

@article{Loh2005,
	abstract = {A recent paper by Matuttis and Ito questions the numerical accuracy of a widely-used fermion Monte Carlo algorithm. They also claim that the increase in the d-wave pairfield susceptibility $\chi$d(T) of a doped 4 × 4 Hubbard model at low temperature, previously found using this algorithm, is an artifact due to numerical errors. Here, we provide tests which show that this algorithm is numerically accurate and show that the simulation of $\chi$d for a 2 × 2 lattice agrees with exact diagonalization results. We also provide more complete data for $\chi$d on a 4×4 lattice that is consistent with our previous results.},
