@FOOTNOTE{Note1,key="Note1",note="Note that we intentionally do not discuss the option to calculate $B^M$ as $U D^M X$ since typically the system will be interacting and the $B$ matrices in the product chain will differ."}
@FOOTNOTE{Note2,key="Note2",note="Note that Fortran LAPACK functions are named according to realness and symmetries of the matrix. In Julia multiple-dispatch takes care of routing different matrix types to different \protect \textit  {methods}. The Julia function \protect \texttt  {gesdd} works for both real and complex matrices, i.e. there is no (need for) \protect \texttt  {cgesdd}."}
