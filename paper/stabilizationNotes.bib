In Julia multiple-dispatch takes care of routing different matrix types to different \protect \textit  {methods}. The Julia function \protect \texttt  {gesdd} works for both real and complex matrices, i.e. there is no (need for) \protect \texttt  {cgesdd}."}

@FOOTNOTE{Note4,key="Note4",note="For local updates on can generally avoid full calculations of Green's function determinants by exploiting locality and performing a Laplace expansion since only ratios of determinants appear in Eq.~\ref {eq:metropolis}. In fact, in an optimal implementation the computation of the acceptance rate is $O(1)$ rather than $O(N^3)$."}
